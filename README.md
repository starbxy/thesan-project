here is a very brief description for each file —<br><br>

read_3d: creates 1d histograms for a variable with different weightings<br>
read_3d_2: creates 2d histograms (the one i currently have on this repo creates 2 x 2d histograms, but you can modify this to create as many as you want)<br>
read_3d_a: i think this file is kind of redundant - just creates 1d histograms for any variable of interest for a singular weighting<br>
read_3d_b: calculates the volume-average for some particular variable in each snapshot/redshift<br><br>

read_lightrays: histograms for a defined cut-off redshift (i haven’t actually used this file much, was just performing tests etc)<br>
read_lightrays_2: creates histograms and groups different redshift (and corresponding x_HI) ranges together to compare regimes<br>
read_lightrays_3: plots variable evolution vs redshift for each lightray and median/+-1 sigma<br>
read_lightrays_4: this just does the same as lightrays_3 but places the plots side by side to compare various density thresholds<br>
